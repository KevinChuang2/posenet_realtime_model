# posenet_realtime_model

My implementation of combining Tensorflow's posenet and Three.js. This manipulates a rigged model to copy the movements of a person through their webcam, with bonus added special effects. The goal of this was a proof of concept as a real time view of special effects that could be used by movies to preview what a scene would look like before CGI was added.

Included Effects:
Lava Spiral
Lightning
Volumetric Fire

Excluded Effects:
